# Unit 03 Password Generator #
## User Story ##
* Created this password generator to help me better understand the different capabilities and flexibility javascript has.
* Javascipt is a beast of language and their is a million ways to do one thing, this project alone has taught me the importance of slowing and simplifying the code. Take it one step at a time.
* I have a long ways to go when it comes to javascript and did my best with this project, but im excited to see where im at in 5 months.
* This project solves a particular issue I have with weak passwords that are easly hacked
